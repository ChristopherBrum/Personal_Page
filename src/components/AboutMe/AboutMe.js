                <p>I have lived in California my whole life, but am currently exploring {props.place} on my motorcycle. I am trying to ride my motorcycle around the world, albeit slowly, and my pit stop here in Bogot√° is to attend a Fullstack Development Bootcamp. Ideally I will be able to work remotely from different places in the world along my journey.  </p>
